The Center for Living Systems (CLS) at the University of Chicago is a National Science Foundation Physics Frontier Center. CLS researchers study how living systems process cues from their environment to determine and adapt their form and function.  This research inherently demands and will establish a new field of physics that focuses on how physical systems can store, retrieve, and process information to control complex behavior. The CLS will develop education and outreach programs to expand physics education, train the next generation of researchers and bring the joy of CLS research to the South Side of Chicago. Our faculty come from 10 departments at the University of Chicago across the physical and biological sciences and a leader in physics education from Northwestern University.

Center Leadership:
Margaret L. Gardel, Director
Arvind Murugan, Associate Director
